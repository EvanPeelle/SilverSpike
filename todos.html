<!-- PURPOSE:
DESIGNED:
depth of execution with many actions in line.
[not spreading thinner with many types]
/context/filt [ ]*
/track progss [+]
/gamify productivity [ ]
/vis prod in stages. [ ]

BUGS:
- making doughnut responsive.

- git authorization key is still there - security.
- vision input broken. line 307

PRODUCT TODOS:
filtering - move actions from weekly to doing project(speed key)
filtering - show a quick view of next actions and waiting fors(summary box)
filtering - show each action by context at bottom of page(summary box)
filtering - create a waiting for time to recall
filtering - create a delegat button for bucket to show up later
filtering - create multiple divs for each action context type in a project
filtering - create a logic tree option on waiting actions
filtering - create folding projects if not active(showing only actions and waiting in summary boxes)
visualize - the completed actions of day/projects open/rate of change/etc/gant chart
connect with twillio api
- sms message on the go events to my phone as text messages

host site for global access

PERSONAL GROWTH:
refactor in design patterns iif
refactor with .prototype
auto refresh browser when working on it in sublime


MAYBE:
- browser window launcher on a schedule.
- develop calendar integration
- develop a timely send down of desktop tasks.(csv download?)


DONE:
- delete projects as done...
/execute      [√]
/update       [√]
/collect      [√]
/process      [√]
single place. [√]
waits/done          [√]
depth of action     [√]
completion/         [√]
project pods -      [√]
speed of work flow, [√]
simplicity of visual[√]
flexibility of items[√]
- css classing system (remove ids) formatting
- color coding the graph with the type text.
reference scratch pad
- remove duplicate speed key for each input.
tag further actions with that project name
- develop a DOing DASH
 - shift over to that page fully
 - do i host another page? or Jquery good enough, Backbone?
 - speed key menu for this page only.
- probably create a new project with each rehaul in the weekly review.
  - choose only a select few projects to track and work on over time.
- seperate all the work and personal lists
- DONE function and how to deal with that query for future reference.
 - place all of the stickies dones' into it as list items imported...
- Someday maybe category & How to interact with it???
- placing a horizon tag on each item processed through list.
//build a place to send those items in HTML.
    //integrate the functionality with the location.
- updating the graph with real time data.
- make each type of item fit a query to populate on the dom.
- then have each one easily updated.
//complete the filtering functionality.
//remove duplication of spans on timeout().
- append the items from query on upload of page.
- get extra inputs do the same:
- make updating work on any item
- make deleting work without 1 off error.
//integrate with DropBox data store.
* what do I want to persist?
//store first peice of data.
  //retrieve first peice of data.
develop weekly review checklist
develop output to be relevant
add filter functionality.
 - do i really need reference?
see one item being worked on at a time. smooth fade in of items as added or removed. smooth fade out when skipped over to next element input.hidden gridation of opacity as list goes down...
- script and html dependencies layout. IIF
- error handle the dependency loading issues... IIF
- clean up files to be singular
my mind needs to be clearer than the code.
- do server stuff on another file all together for experimentation.
- figure out how to join the two.
- contact staff dude de cruz, peter, to consult.
