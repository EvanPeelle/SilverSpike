<!-- PURPOSE:
speed up and clearly

single place. [ ]

DESIGNED:
depth of execution with many actions in line.
[not spreading thinner with many types]
gamify productivity [ ]
waits/done          [ ]
now whats/          [ ]
depth of action     [ ]
completion/         [ ]
project pods -      [ ]
speed of work flow, [ ]
simplicity of visual[ ]
flexibility of items[ ]
vis prod in stages. [ ]

BUGS:
- making graph responsive to number of li's per horizon.
- git authorization key is still there - security.
- remove duplicate speed key for each input.

PERSONAL GROWTH:
refactor in design patterns iif

PRODUCT TODOS:
- consider reference and how that might be handled...???
- Someday maybe category & How to interact with it???
- DONE function and how to deal with that query for future reference.
 - place all of the stickies dones' into it as list items imported...
- connect with twillio api
  - sms message on the go events to my phone as text messages
- host site for global access
- develop a doing dashboard
 - shift over to that page fully
 - do i host another page? or Jquery good enough, Backbone?
 - speed key menu for this page only.
- complete a task and it adds to a graph bar, # of tasks created and done. or % complete of total for the day
- folding projects bullet points for reference...?
- filter by projects(add persistant tag)
- develop gant/odesk/wait pushing, action hoping setup.
- logic tree development on project paths using actions and waiting.

COSMETICS:
- add a % of in to rest in the center of the d3 graph.
- color coding the graph with the type text.
- moving headlines of inputs to the left side.
- css classing system (remove ids) formatting

MAYBE:
- browser window launcher on a schedule.
- develop calendar integration
- develop a timely send down of desktop tasks.(csv download?)




DONE:
- placing a horizon tag on each item processed through list.
//build a place to send those items in HTML.
    //integrate the functionality with the location.
- updating the graph with real time data.
- make each type of item fit a query to populate on the dom.
- then have each one easily updated.
//complete the filtering functionality.
//remove duplication of spans on timeout().
- append the items from query on upload of page.
- get extra inputs do the same:
- make updating work on any item
- make deleting work without 1 off error.
//integrate with DropBox data store.
* what do I want to persist?
//store first peice of data.
  //retrieve first peice of data.
develop weekly review checklist
develop output to be relevant
add filter functionality.
 - do i really need reference?
see one item being worked on at a time. smooth fade in of items as added or removed. smooth fade out when skipped over to next element input.hidden gridation of opacity as list goes down...
- script and html dependencies layout. IIF
- error handle the dependency loading issues... IIF
- clean up files to be singular
my mind needs to be clearer than the code.
- do server stuff on another file all together for experimentation.
- figure out how to join the two.
- contact staff dude de cruz, peter, to consult.
